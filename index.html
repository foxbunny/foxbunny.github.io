    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Hajime Yamasaki VukeliÄ‡</h1>
    <p>Most teams think frustration is just part of the job.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ðŸ‘Ž <span class="highlight">Clunky UI</span> that confuses users.</li>
        <li>ðŸ‘Ž <span class="highlight">Code</span> that becomes impossible to maintain.</li>
        <li>ðŸ‘Ž <span class="highlight">Endless rituals</span> that drain time and energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But what if it wasnâ€™t?</p>
    
    <h2>How about this?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ðŸš€ <span class="highlight">Frustration-free UI</span> â†’ A UI so smooth that users donâ€™t even think about it.</li>
        <li>ðŸš€ <span class="highlight">Frustration-free maintenance</span> â†’ A codebase so simple that maintaining it feels effortless.</li>
        <li>ðŸš€ <span class="highlight">Frustration-free teams</span> â†’ A team that moves faster, with less friction, and actually enjoys their work.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Is it real, though?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ðŸ’¥ I made <a href="infinite-scrolling-lessons.html">infinite scrolling</a> feel effortless on mobileâ€”at a time when people thought it was impossible.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¥ I built an OTA update system for a custom Linux distro that could survive power outages and work over ultra-slow networksâ€”so users never had to worry about failed updates.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¥ I was <a href="out-of-the-box-passwordless-login.html">implementing passwordless login</a>, making logins fast and easy without sacrificing securityâ€”long before it became an industry trend.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¥ I worked on a project where 2 developers spent 6 months building a React-MobX dashboardâ€”only for another developer to replace it with a vanilla version in just 3 weeks. The difference? Removing friction.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¥ I published a collection of vanilla UI patterns and developer training materials to help teams leverage the platform more effectivelyâ€”whether they work with frameworks or not.</li>
    </ul>
