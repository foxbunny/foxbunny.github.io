        <h2>🚨 The problem</h2>
        <p>While implementing a password reset feature, I realized something: the process of resetting passwords was already <span class="highlight">secure and user-friendly</span>. So why not take it a step further and remove passwords altogether?</p>
        <p>Back then, <span class="highlight">passwordless login was rare</span>, but I saw an opportunity to simplify authentication while improving security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>⚠️ The challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔐 Users often forget passwords, creating <span class="highlight">friction and support overhead</span>.</li>
            <li>📩 Email-based login links were <span class="highlight">uncommon in consumer applications at the time</span>, and users weren’t familiar with it.</li>
            <li>🔒 Ensuring the security of login links was crucial—making them <span class="highlight">tamper-proof, preventing replay attacks, and avoiding token leakage</span> were key challenges.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💡 The solution</h2>
        
        <p>I designed a <span class="highlight">passwordless authentication system</span> where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>📨 A <span class="highlight">single-use, short-lived token</span> is sent via email.</li>
            <li>🔗 Clicking the link <span class="highlight">authenticates the user instantly</span>—no password needed.</li>
            <li>⏳ Tokens expire quickly, ensuring <span class="highlight">secure, time-limited access</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method, now used by services like <strong>Wolt, Slack, and Medium</strong>, was relatively rare at the time.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>📈 The impact</h2>
        <p>By eliminating passwords, we reduced authentication friction and improved security at the same time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Lowered <span class="highlight">support requests</span> related to password resets.</li>
            <li>✅ Increased <span class="highlight">user retention</span> by making logins effortless.</li>
            <li>✅ Reduced the risk of <span class="highlight">password-related breaches</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even today, many companies struggle with balancing security and usability in authentication. The key isn’t always following mainstream trends—it’s about finding the right approach for your users. That’s what I help teams do.</p>

        <h2>🎓 The lesson learned</h2>
        <p>Innovation in UX isn’t about following trends—it’s about finding solutions that truly fit the user's needs.</p>
        <p>This project wasn’t just about passwordless login—it was about questioning assumptions and discovering alternative patterns that reduce friction and improve usability. Whether it's authentication, navigation, or interaction design, the key is to rethink established conventions and find solutions that make user experiences smoother and more intuitive.</p>
