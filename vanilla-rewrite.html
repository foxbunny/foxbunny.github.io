    <section>
        <h2>🚨 The problem</h2>
        <p>The original dashboard was built using <span class="highlight">React and MobX</span> over the course of six months by two developers. While it functioned well, maintaining it would have been significantly more work compared to a vanilla implementation.</p>
        <p>The team decided to <span class="highlight">move to a vanilla stack</span> to improve performance, reduce dependency overhead, and simplify long-term maintenance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>⚠️ The challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="🛠️">Developers had to <span class="highlight">rethink how they built UIs</span> without relying on framework patterns.</li>
            <li data-bullet="🚀">Convincing management that a rewrite was <span class="highlight">not just an experiment</span>, but a tangible productivity boost.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>💡 The solution</h2>
        <p>A developer with <span class="highlight">little prior vanilla experience</span> was assigned to the rewrite. The goal: achieve feature parity as fast as possible while improving performance and maintainability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="📜">Created a <span class="highlight">manifesto</span> to align both the team and management, ensuring everyone understood how vanilla development supported project goals.</li>
            <li data-bullet="❌">Removed nearly all dependencies <span class="highlight">except for essentials</span> (Excel export, charting).</li>
            <li data-bullet="⚡">Rebuilt the app from scratch, completing the rewrite <span class="highlight">in just 3 weeks</span>, using a standardized structure that avoided reinventing an in-house framework.</li>
            <li data-bullet="📚">Incorporated training and revisions to help the developer <span class="highlight">adopt the vanilla mindset</span>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>📈 The impact</h2>
        <p>The rewrite resulted in a <span class="highlight">simpler, more maintainable, and higher-performing codebase</span> with significantly reduced complexity.</p>
        <ul class="impact">
            <li>Reduced <span class="highlight">development time</span> from 6 months to just 3 weeks—an increase in speed by <span class="highlight">16×</span> (or an <span class="highlight">87.5% decrease</span> in development time).</li>
            <li>Improved <span class="highlight">application performance</span>, even though performance was not a primary concern.</li>
            <li>Proved that <span class="highlight">framework-free development</span> can be highly efficient in the right environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This case highlights how much efficiency a vanilla stack can bring to a project. Sometimes, preemptively improving software yields better results than waiting for things to get out of hand.</p>

        <h2>🎓 The lessons learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="⚡"><span class="highlight">Simpler technologies</span>, while requiring effort to master, ultimately produce results much faster.</li>
            <li data-bullet="💡">Developers are much more <span class="highlight">resourceful</span> than they believe when given freedom and support to explore solutions.</li>
            <li data-bullet="🚀">Going with <span class="highlight">non-standard solutions</span> can pay off big time when applied in the right context.</li>
        </ul>
