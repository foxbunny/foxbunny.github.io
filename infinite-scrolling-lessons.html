        <h1>📖 The UX lesson that stuck with me for over 10 years</h1>

        <h2>🚨 The problem</h2>
        <p>In 2013, I worked on a digital book project targeting <strong>Android and iOS tablets</strong>, especially Retina iPads, which were underpowered for their high resolution. The client requested a <strong>hybrid app</strong> instead of a native one to save development costs.</p>
        <p>The goal was to enable <strong>smooth horizontal swiping</strong> between pages while dynamically loading and unloading content to optimize memory usage. However, the rendering performance was a major challenge.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>⚠️ The challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="📸">Loading new <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements or background images <strong>froze the UI</strong> while they loaded.</li>
            <li data-bullet="🐢">Rendering performance was <strong>especially sluggish on iPads</strong> due to their high-resolution displays and underpowered GPUs.</li>
            <li data-bullet="👆">Swiping felt <strong>laggy and unresponsive</strong> due to rendering delays.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💡 The solution</h2>
        <p>To achieve smooth performance, I implemented a few creative workarounds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="🚀">Used a <strong>GPU-accelerated &lt;canvas&gt;</strong> instead of <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements to preload and render images seamlessly.</li>
            <li data-bullet="🎭">Implemented a <strong>3D transform hack</strong> to take advantage of GPU acceleration for fluid swiping.</li>
            <li data-bullet="📜">Added and removed pages <strong>dynamically in the swiping direction</strong> while using margins to maintain layout stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📈 The impact</h2>
        <p>The biggest success of this project was achieving <span class="highlight">native-like performance and interactivity</span> in a hybrid app, making it feel as smooth as a fully native implementation.</p>
        <ul class="impact">
            <li>Enabled <span class="highlight">seamless, lag-free scrolling</span> on underpowered devices.</li>
            <li>Allowed the project to be built as a <span class="highlight">hybrid app</span>, reducing development costs compared to native alternatives.</li>
            <li>Proved that <span class="highlight">performance is critical to UX</span>—users don’t just see speed, they feel it.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🎓 The lesson learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li data-bullet="🚅">Performance is <strong>crucial for UX</strong>. A laggy experience breaks immersion, and users will always feel it—whether they realize it or not.</li>
            <li data-bullet="🔧">Interestingly, <strong>none of the techniques used here are directly supported by modern frameworks</strong>. Performance problems often require <strong>platform-specific optimizations</strong>, and relying purely on frameworks won’t solve them. By going beyond what frameworks and libraries typically address, we can expand our repertoire of techniques that we can use in performance-critical situations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even today, ensuring <span class="highlight">buttery-smooth UI interactions</span> remains one of the most important aspects of UX. The best performance optimizations are often the ones that go beyond standard approaches.</p>
