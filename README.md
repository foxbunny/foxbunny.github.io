# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Hajime
Most teams think frustration is just part of the job.

ðŸ‘Ž Clunky UI that confuses users.  
ðŸ‘Ž Code that becomes impossible to maintain.  
ðŸ‘Ž Endless rituals that drain time and energy.  

But what if it wasnâ€™t?

## How about this?
ðŸš€ **Frustration-free UI** â†’ A UI so smooth that users donâ€™t even think about it.  
ðŸš€ **Frustration-free maintenance** â†’ A codebase so simple that maintaining it feels effortless.  
ðŸš€ **Frustration-free teams** â†’ A team that moves faster, with less friction, and actually enjoys their work.  

## Is it real, though?
ðŸ’¥ I made [infinite scrolling feel effortless](https://open.substack.com/pub/hajimeyamasakivukelic/p/they-dont-teach-you-this-in-school?r=2djtwp&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) on mobileâ€”at a time when people thought it was impossible.  
ðŸ’¥ I built an OTA update system for a custom Linux distro that could survive power outages and work over ultra-slow networksâ€”so users never had to worry about failed updates.  
ðŸ’¥ I helped pioneer passwordless login via email, making logins fast and easy without sacrificing securityâ€”long before it became an industry trend.  
ðŸ’¥ I worked on a project where 2 developers spent 6 months building a React-MobX dashboardâ€”only for another developer to replace it with a vanilla version in just 3 weeks. The difference? Removing friction.  
ðŸ’¥ I published a collection of vanilla UI patterns and developer training materials to help teams leverage the platform more effectivelyâ€”whether they work with frameworks or not.  

**Whatâ€™s the biggest source of frustration in your product right now?** Letâ€™s talk.
