# 👋 Hey, I’m Hajime
Most teams think frustration is just part of the job.

👎 Clunky UI that confuses users.  
👎 Code that becomes impossible to maintain.  
👎 Endless rituals that drain time and energy.  

But what if it wasn’t?

## How about this?
🚀 **Frustration-free UI** → A UI so smooth that users don’t even think about it.  
🚀 **Frustration-free maintenance** → A codebase so simple that maintaining it feels effortless.  
🚀 **Frustration-free teams** → A team that moves faster, with less friction, and actually enjoys their work.  

## Is it real, though?
💥 I made [infinite scrolling feel effortless][cs1] on mobile—at a time when people thought it was impossible.  
💥 I built an OTA update system for a custom Linux distro that could survive power outages and work over ultra-slow networks—so users never had to worry about failed updates.  
💥 I was implementing passwordless login, making logins fast and easy without sacrificing security—long before it became an industry trend.  
💥 I worked on a project where 2 developers spent 6 months building a React-MobX dashboard—only for another developer to replace it with a vanilla version in just 3 weeks. The difference? Removing friction.  
💥 I published a collection of vanilla UI patterns and developer training materials to help teams leverage the platform more effectively—whether they work with frameworks or not.
